Grid frequency is in a constant state of fluctuation, which is increased by unpredictable incidents. Use the four controllers to adjust power production at the decentralized power plants and rebalance grid frequency. If the frequency decreases, power production needs to rise or demand needs to fall. If frequency rises, try reducing power production or increasing the demand for power. \nQuick tip: At the bottom edge of the screen, you can switch from manual mode to VPP mode to see how the automatic control system in a Virtual Power Plant works. ","simulation_backButton_text":"Back to the home page","simulation_backButton_title":"Virtual Power Plant for biogas, solar, wind, CHP, and demand-side management","simulation_backbutton_app_text":"Back to NextDisplay","simulation_infoIndustry":"\nIt\u2019s not just power producers helping keep the grid steady \u2013power consumers can take part using demand-side management. But don\u2019t forget \u2013 this is a bit counterintuitive: If an industrial process consumes more power, frequency will fall; if it consumes less, frequency will rise.","simulation_infoBio":"Biogas power plants that are integrated into a Virtual Power Plant can reliably adjust their power production due to their CHP-based power production. They produce valuable balancing reserves, preventing blackouts on the grid. Next Kraftwerke has already integrated more than 1,000 biogas power plants into its Virtual Power Plant Next Pool. And the number continues to grow every day...","simulation_infoWater":"Pumped-storage hydro  plants have been providing balancing reserves for several decades. Run-of-river hydro power stations  \u2013 with and without reservoirs \u2013 also have an important role to play in maintaining a balanced power grid by quickly adjusting their power production.","simulation_infoWood":"Fossil power plants are not the only ones that can be controlled; balancing reserves come from a range of new power plant types if they are part of a Virtual Power Plant. These include sewage gas plants, waste-to-energy plants, and wood-fired CHP plants.","simulation_infoWind":"Due to their volatile power production, wind energy installations cannot provide balancing reserves. Nevertheless, they are part of the Virtual Power Plant to evaluate their status and check it against the weather forecast. If prices on the power markets are negative, the Virtual Power Plant can reduce power production from wind assets. ","simulation_infoHaushalt":"Private households are not yet included in the Virtual \nPower Plant, but they may offer a range of possibilities in the future. Given their similarities to industrial processes, home appliances are capable of brief adjustments to power consumption. Refrigerators are a well-known example.","simulation_infoSolar":"Like wind energy plants, solar plants are also part of the Virtual Power Plant Next Pool. Their volatile production also means they are not yet suited for balancing reserves. However, solar power plants are still part of the Virtual Power Plant and can be shut down when prices on the power exchanges are negative.","simulation_infoNetze":"The power grid can only transport power; storing power is not possible. To avoid a blackout, the power grid needs to run at a frequency of 50 hertz. If the frequency drops below 49.98 hertz or rises above 50.02 hertz, balancing reserves are called up to keep the grid at a steady frequency. When grid frequency drops below 49.8 hertz or rises above 50.2 hertz, the transmission system operator must take emergency measures that are not included in this game.","simulation_infoVKW":"Next Kraftwerke operates a Virtual Power Plant that is active in seven European control areas. Renewable energies are part of the Next Pool, Next Kraftwerke&#39;s Virtual Power Plant. They play an important role in maintaining grid frequency by supplying balancing reserves through a centralized control system. The Next Pool is headquartered in Cologne, Germany. From this central control system all individual units are automatically controlled should the grid become unbalanced.","simulation_updateBrowser_text":"We&#39;re sorry, but the NextFrequency game does not support your current browser version.
